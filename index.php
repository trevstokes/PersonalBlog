				<h2>Welcome to my Blog</h2>
				<p>My name is Trevor Stokes. I am a tech enthusiast, albeit with often critical views of the industry. This site is a platform for presenting my opinions on various business and technology related topics.</p>
				
				<p>I try my best to consider all perspectives when writing critiques, and will try to incorporate that sensibility along with my rationale in all of my blog posts. I welcome any and all comments, whether they challenge my views or not.</p>
				
				<p>Together, we all can learn from each other!</p>
